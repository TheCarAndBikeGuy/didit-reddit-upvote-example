# my-eleventh-assignment / Fork Github Repo

Deployed On Vercel - https://didit-reddit-upvote-example-inky.vercel.app/

I tried my best to finish this assignment, I managed to fork it and code into it just not get the login to work properly. I think I could not get the login to work properly due to my DB and the connections to Git Hub. I found working out how to get the page to work hard and what to import into VSCode. It was a tough challenge but I think I tried my best to get it done.
